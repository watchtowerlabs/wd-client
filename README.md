# Watchdog Client (Open-Source)

This Watchdog Client is an open-source version forked from the SatNOGS Ground Station Client with modifications for the Watchtower network.
The package automates the reception of signals from satellites (cubesats, amateur radio satellites, weather satellites) for the Watchtower network.
