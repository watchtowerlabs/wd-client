======================================
Installing SatNOGS on a Raspberry Pi 3
======================================

This tutorial assumes the following:

1. You have a Raspberry Pi 3 with external power (5V, 2A).

2. USB keyboard, HDMI screen, HDMI cable, network cable (Wi-Fi isn't working on Fedora for now) and a Class 10 SDHC card at least 8GB.

3. One of the following sdr devices: RTL-SDR or USRP B200.

4. You have an account and a ground station registered on either `network.satnogs.org <https://network.satnogs.org>`_ or `network-dev.satnogs.org <https://network-dev.satnogs.org>`_. This is needed for getting your ground station ID number and your SatNOGS Network API key.

-----------------------
1. Prepare Raspberry Pi
-----------------------

**Step 1.1:** Download fedora minimal or server RPi image (current 25) from `ARM Fedora Project <https://arm.fedoraproject.org/>`_ (server edition provides a nice web interface, admin console, with several stats and SSH access).

**Step 1.2:** Connect SD card to your computer/laptop and prepare it as described at `Fedora Wiki <https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi#Preparing_the_SD_card>`_ (don't forget to `resize the root partition <https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi#Resizing_the_root_partition>`_).

**Step 1.3:** Attach sdcard to your RPi, plug in the HDMI cable, keyboard and ethernet and turn on the HDMI screen. Plug RPi to the power source.

**Step 1.4:** Fedora installation starts, follow the steps that show up in the screen. You'll have to setup:
  * root password
  * network connection
  * timezone and ntp server, add at least one, `pool.ntp.org` is suggested
  * a new user, e.g. `satnogs`. Don't forget to set administrator flag and add user to `dialout` group (needed for having access to sdr device).

**Step 1.5:** From now on you are able to access you RPi directly or through SSH. You can also use admin console if you have selected the fedora server version.

**Step 1.6:** Update fedora package to the latest version by running::

    sudo dnf -y update

**Step 1.7:** Install dependencies for gr-satnogs and satnogs-client::

    sudo dnf install -y util-linux-user git gcc redhat-rpm-config python-devel redis vorbis-tools hamlib gnuradio gnuradio-devel cmake swig fftw3-devel gcc-c++ cppunit cppunit-devel doxygen gr-osmosdr libnova libnova-devel gnuplot libvorbis-devel libffi-devel openssl-devel libpng-devel

**Step 1.8:** In order to expand the lifetime of the SD Card, edit /etc/fstab file with your favourite editor:
  * Comment out the line of the swap partition
  * Only if you used the "minimal" Fedora installation (not the "server" build), change options of root partition line (/ ext4) from `defaults,noatime` to `defaults,noatime,commit=1800`. This change means that changes on root partition will be written on SD Card every 30min
  * Move /var/log and /var/tmp directories to memory by adding the following two lines::

      tmpfs /var/tmp tmpfs defaults,noatime,nosuid,size=20m 0 0
      tmpfs /var/log tmpfs defaults,noatime,nosuid,mode=0755,size=80m 0 0

**Step 1.9:** Automate creating of redis directory in /var/log path after boot by running::

    sudo sh -c 'echo "#Type Path                Mode UID   GID   Age Argument" > /etc/tmpfiles.d/logdirs.conf'
    sudo sh -c 'echo "d     /var/log/redis      0750 redis redis 1d  -" >> /etc/tmpfiles.d/logdirs.conf'

**Step 1.10:** Enable and start Redis service in order to run automatically on startup::

    sudo systemctl enable redis.service
    sudo systemctl start redis.service

**Step 1.11:** Configure automatic cleanup of old data (while this is an optional step, if old files are not cleaned out regularly you run the risk of filling your disk over time)
  * As-is this will clean out files older than 1 week. Adjust mtime to your liking
  * Create /etc/cron.daily/satnogs with your favorite editor and add the following::

      #!/bin/sh
      find /tmp/.satnogs/data -type f -mtime +7 -delete

  * Then run::

      sudo chmod +x /etc/cron.daily/satnogs


---------------------
2. Install gr-satnogs
---------------------

SatNOGS Client uses GNU Radio scripts in order to get observation data from satelites, gr-satnogs provide this functionality.

**Step 2.1:**: Install gr-satnogs by running the next commands::

    git clone https://github.com/satnogs/gr-satnogs.git
    cd gr-satnogs
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake -DLIB_SUFFIX=64 -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr ..
    make -j4
    sudo make install
    sudo sh -c 'echo /usr/lib64 > /etc/ld.so.conf.d/lib64.conf'
    sudo ldconfig

-------------------------
3. Install satnogs-client
-------------------------

Building from source is outside of the scope of this document, we will use the packaged install for now.

**Step 3.1:** Run the following command to install the packaged version of SatNOGS Client::

   sudo pip install satnogsclient==0.3

---------------------------
4. Configure satnogs-client
---------------------------

SatNOGS Client needs some configuration before running:

**Step 4.1:** Create a .env file in your home directory (`~/.env`) and add station's details as they are defined at SatNOGS Network::

    export SATNOGS_API_TOKEN="1234567890qwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm1234"
    export SATNOGS_STATION_ID="65"
    export SATNOGS_STATION_LAT="40.662"
    export SATNOGS_STATION_LON="23.337"
    export SATNOGS_STATION_ELEV="150"
    export SATNOGS_NETWORK_API_URL="https://network-dev.satnogs.org/api/"

.. _optional_settings:

**Step 4.2:** There are more option you can export in the created .env file. You will probably need to change the default values of the settings bellow:

SATNOGS_RX_DEVICE
  * Defines the sdr device. It could be 'usrpb200' or 'rtlsdr'.
  * Default Type: string
  * Default Value: 'rtlsdr'

SATNOGS_PPM_ERROR
  * Defines PPM error of sdr, check :doc:`finding-ppm` for more details on PPM.
  * Default Type: integer
  * Default Value: 0

**Step 4.3:** Other optional settings:

SATNOGS_APP_PATH
  * Defines the path where the sqlite database will be created.
  * Default Type: string
  * Default Value: '/tmp/.satnogs'

SATNOGS_OUTPUT_PATH
  * Defines the path where the observation data will be saved.
  * Default Type: string
  * Default Value: '/tmp/.satnogs/data'

SATNOGS_COMPLETE_OUTPUT_PATH
  * Defines the path where data will be moved after succesful upload on network.
  * Default Type: string
  * Default Value: '/tmp/.satnogs/data/complete'

SATNOGS_INCOMPLETE_OUTPUT_PATH
  * Defines the path where data will be moved after unsuccesful upload on network.
  * Default Type: string
  * Default Value: '/tmp/.satnogs/data/incomplete'

SATNOGS_ROT_IP
  * Defines IP address where rotctld process listens.
  * Default Type: string
  * Default Value: '127.0.0.1'

SATNOGS_ROT_PORT
  * Defines port where rotctld process listens.
  * Default Type: integer
  * Default Value: 4533

SATNOGS_RIG_IP
  * Defines IP address where rigctld process listens.
  * Default Type: string
  * Default Value: '127.0.0.1'

SATNOGS_RIG_PORT
  * Defines port where rigctld process listens.
  * Default Type: integer
  * Default Value: 4532

---------------------
5. Prepare SDR Device
---------------------
In order to have access and use SDR device you need to follow the next steps for you device:

^^^^^^^^^^^^
1. USRP B200
^^^^^^^^^^^^
**Step 5.1.1:** Install uhd package::

    sudo dnf install -y uhd

**Step 5.1.2:** Download uhd images::

    sudo /usr/bin/uhd_images_downloader

**Step 5.1.3:** As the access will be only by ssh and not by direct login we are not be able to access SDR device through `Access Control List(ACL) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Access_control_list>`_, so we need to setup the appropriate udev rules by following the next steps:

  * Copy udev rules from `/usr/lib/udev/rules.d/10-usrp-uhd.rules` to `/etc/udev/rules.d/10-usrp-uhd.rules`::

      sudo cp /usr/lib/udev/rules.d/10-usrp-uhd.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/10-usrp-uhd.rules

  * Replace ACL reference::

      sudo sed -i 's/0", ENV{ID_SOFTWARE_RADIO}="1"/6"/g' /etc/udev/rules.d/10-usrp-uhd.rules

  * Reload udev rules::

      sudo udevadm control --reload-rules

  * Confirm access on device by running (without sudo, just as single user)::

      uhd_find_devices

  * In case you don't have access, make sure that the device is connected and that the created user is member of the `dialout` group by running::

      groups

  * If user isn't member of `dialout` group run (replace satnogs with the username of your user)::

      sudo usermod -aG dialout satnogs

^^^^^^^^^^^^
2. RTL-SDR
^^^^^^^^^^^^
**Step 5.2.1:** As the access will be only by ssh and not by direct login we are not be able to access SDR device through `Access Control List(ACL) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Access_control_list>`_, so we need to setup the appropriate udev rules by following the next steps:

  * Copy udev rules from `/usr/lib/udev/rules.d/10-rtl-sdr.rules` to `/etc/udev/rules.d/10-rtl-sdr.rules`::

      sudo cp /usr/lib/udev/rules.d/10-rtl-sdr.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/10-rtl-sdr.rules

  * Replace ACL reference and change group ownership::

      sudo sed -i 's/0", ENV{ID_SOFTWARE_RADIO}="1"/6"/g' /etc/udev/rules.d/10-rtl-sdr.rules
      sudo sed -i 's/rtlsdr/dialout/g' /etc/udev/rules.d/10-rtl-sdr.rules

  * Reload udev rules::

      sudo udevadm control --reload-rules

  * If your rtlsdr device was already plugged in, you will need to unplug it and plug it back in. Otherwise, it is safe to plug it in now.

  * In case you don't have access, make sure that the device is connected and that the created user is member of the `dialout` group by running::

      groups

  * If user isn't member of `dialout` group run (replace satnogs with the username of your user)::

      sudo usermod -aG dialout satnogs

  * If you had to take that step, log out and log back in

---------------------
6. Run satnogs-client
---------------------
^^^^^^^^^^^
1. Manually
^^^^^^^^^^^
In order to manually run satnogs-client you need to follow the next steps:

**Step 6.1.1:** Export all the environment variables::

    source .env

**Step 6.1.2:** Start rotctl daemon(note: given example parameters bellow, you may need to change, add or omit some of them. For a Yaesu G-5500 use -m 601 and -s 9600)::

    rotctld -m 202 -r /dev/ttyACM0 -s 19200 &

**Step 6.1.3:** Run the SatNOGS Client::

    satnogs-client

**At this point your client should be fully functional! It will check in with the network URL at a 1 minute interval. You should check your ground station page on the website, the station ID will be in a red box until the station checks in, at which time it will turn green. There are many ways to automate the running and control of satnogs, we will give you 2 options below, supervisord and systemd.**

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
2. Automaticaly with Supervisord
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

`Supervisord <http://supervisord.org/introduction.html>`_ is one of the ways to automatically run SatNOGS Client. This is very useful especialy after a power failure or reboot of raspberry pi.

In order to setup supervisord we need to follow the next steps:

**Step 6.2.1:** Install supervisord::

    sudo dnf install -y supervisor

**Step 6.2.2:** Automate creating of supervisor directory in /var/log path after boot by running::

    sudo sh -c 'echo "d     /var/log/supervisor 0750 root  root  3d  -" >> /etc/tmpfiles.d/logdirs.conf'

**Step 6.2.3:** Configure supervisord for rotctld

Open with sudo and your favorite editor and add this into /etc/supervisord.d/rotctld.ini::

   [program:rotctld]
   command=/usr/bin/rotctld <rotctld PARAMETERS>
   autostart=true
   autorestart=true
   user=<USERNAME>
   priority=1
   stdout_logfile=/var/log/supervisor/rotctld.log
   stderr_logfile=/var/log/supervisor/rotctld-error.log

Replace <USERNAME> with the username of the user you have created and <rotctld PARAMETERS> with the parameters needed to run rotctl in your case.

**Step 6.2.4:** Configure supervisord for satnogs-client

Add this into /etc/supervisord.d/satnogs.ini::

   [program:satnogs]
   command=/usr/bin/satnogs-client
   autostart=true
   autorestart=true
   user=<USERNAME>
   environment=SATNOGS_NETWORK_API_URL="<URL>",SATNOGS_API_TOKEN="<TOKEN>",SATNOGS_STATION_ID="<ID>",SATNOGS_STATION_LAT="<LATITUDE>",SATNOGS_STATION_LON="<LONGITUDE>",SATNOGS_STATION_ELEV="<ELEVATION>"
   stdout_logfile=/var/log/supervisor/satnogs.log
   stderr_logfile=/var/log/supervisor/satnogs-error.log

Replace <USERNAME> with the username of the user you have created.
Replace <...> instances in environment with the values you used in .env file,
you can also add in this list any other of the :ref:`optional settings <optional_settings>`.

**Step 6.2.5:** Reloading supervisord to get the new configuration::

  sudo systemctl enable supervisord.service
  sudo systemctl start supervisord.service

With that rotctld and satnogs-client should have started, you can follow the logs in /var/log/supervisor/.

*NOTE:* In case that you want to change something in .ini files like satnogs environment variables (url from the dev one to production one), then you will need to run::

 sudo supervisorctl reload

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
3. Automaticaly with Systemd
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

`Systemd <https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/>`_ is one of the ways to automatically run SatNOGS Client. This is very useful especialy after a power failure or reboot of raspberry pi.

In order to setup systemd we need to follow the next steps:

**Step 6.3.1:** Create the script which will initialize and run rotctld and satnogs-client in your home directory (`~/start-satnogs-client.sh`) with the following content::

    rotctld <rotctld PARAMETERS> &
    date >> satnogs-auto.log
    source .env
    satnogs-client

Replace <rotctld PARAMETERS> with the parameters needed to run rotctl in your case.

**Step 6.3.2:** Create as root the file /lib/systemd/system/satnogs-client.service and add the following content::

    [Unit]
    Description=Satnogs Client
    Requires=redis.service
    After=redis.service

    [Service]
    User=<USERNAME>
    WorkingDirectory=/home/<USERNAME>/
    ExecStart=/bin/bash start-satnogs-client.sh
    KillMode=control-group

    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target

Replace <USERNAME> with the username of the user you have created.

**Step 6.3.3:** Enable and start satnogs-client.service::

    sudo systemctl enable satnogs-client.service
    sudo systemctl start satnogs-client.service

With that rotctld and satnogs-client should have started, you can follow the logs with journactl::

    journalctl -u satnogs-client.service

Use `-f` flag if you want to see the latest updates on logs::

    journalctl -f -u satnogs-client.service

*NOTE:* In case that you want to change something in start-satnogs-client.sh, make the change and then run::

    sudo systemctl stop satnogs-client.service
    sudo systemctl start satnogs-client.service

*NOTE:* In case that you want to change something in satnogs-client.service, make the change and then run::

    sudo systemctl daemon-reload
